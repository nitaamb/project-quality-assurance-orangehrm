# Project Quality Assurance OrangeHRM
This repository contains examples of manual and automation testing using selenium python I've written.

OrangeHRM is an open-source site for human resource management that is used in this project. In this case, I do functionality testing for several menus such as:
* Admin --> Add User
* PIM --> Add Employee
* Leave --> Check Employee Leave Entitlements
* Time --> Add Customer
* Recruitment --> Add Jo Vacancies
* My Info --> Add Skill
* Performance --> Add KPI
* Dashboard --> Show My Timesheet
* Directory --> Search Directory
* Buzz --> Update Status
